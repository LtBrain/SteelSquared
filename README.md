Hello,

IDK what happened here.

SteelSquared started as a humorous parody to the galvanized square steel and bio-friendly wood veneers trend for Minecraft. 
However, it was also a major stepping stone for the quest to learn Java, and here we are with a big steaming pile of junk :)

Fully made on a potato education issued Chromebook.

Hope you enjoy!
