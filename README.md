Hello,

IDK what happened here.

SteelSquared started as a humorous parody to the galvanized square steel and bio-friendly wood veneers trend for Minecraft. 
However, it was also a major stepping stone for the quest to learn Java, and here we are with a big steaming pile of junk :)

Fully made on a potato education issued Chromebook.
Intellij IDEA for development.
Main Dev Testing done on Windows and Mac Java Edition 1.20.6
Based on Forge MDK
Also based off of Modding by Kaupenjoe's tutorials (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbzPhyLcO8VP25dZ7kaUyAw)

Hope you enjoy the horrors of my first mod!
